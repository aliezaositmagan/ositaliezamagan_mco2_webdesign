            Man throw away almost everywhere, neglecting the fact that dumped trashes and garbage results in unsanitary surroundings that eventually results in disease due to carrying insects and canines.
        </p>

        <p>
            Environment sanitation is not new in the Philippines. Government efforts were already directed towards the protection and promotion of health considered of paramount importance. As a result, Presidential Decree No. 856 otherwise known as "Sanitation Code of the Philippines" was passed on Dec. 1975 and was made part of the law of the land. Paragraph (c), Section 83 of the Decree states that refuse shall not be throwing in any street, sidewalk, yard, and park or in a body of water. It shall be stored in a suitable container while awaiting its final disposal.
