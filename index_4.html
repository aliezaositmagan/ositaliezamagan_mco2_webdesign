        VERSE 1:
            All these pieces
            Broken and scattered
            In mercy gat hered
            Mended and whole
            Empty handed
            But not forsaken
            I've been set free
            I've been set free

        PRE-CHORUS:
            Amazing grace
            How sweet the sound
            That saved a wretch like me
            I once was lost
            But now I am found
            Was blind but now I see

        CHORUS:
            Oh I can see You now
            Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
            Laying Yourself down
            Raising up the broken to life

        VERSE 2:
            You take our failure
            You take our weakness
            You set Your treasure
            In jars of clay

            So take this heart Lord
            I’ll be Your vessel
            The world to see Your life in me

        BRIDGE:
            Take my heart
            Take my soul
            Take my mind and I will
            Give my thoughts
            Give my all
            Give my life to follow You
            Take my hands
            Take my breath
            Take my dreams and I will
            Lift my eyes
            Lift my faith
            Lift my voice and worship You
    </pre>
