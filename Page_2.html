                    <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
                    <h3>THE PROBLEM AND ITS SETTING</h3>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

                    <P>
                        A healthy sanitary enviroment means a highly intellectual and fully aware community people. Man always strives to live in a place where nature bountifully abounds, everything is in order and everybody desires to cross fingers towards a worthwile end. Environmental protection is everyone's concern. As residents of the planet earth, it is one of our responsibilities to keep enviroment healthy and worth living and preserve it for the generations ahead of us.
                   </P>

                    <p>
                       Waste management is a system of handling wastes that is environmentally sound. This system requires information dissemination to the households because some people don't know how to deal with their wastes.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                       Among the problems, it is the waste disposal that involves most people. There are households that would take "short cuts" in disposing garbage and there are those that would comply according to the prescribed methods.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                       Man throw away almost everywhere, neglecting the fact that dumped trashes and garbage results in unsanitary surroundings that eventually results in disease due to carrying insects and canines.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                       Environment sanitation is not new in the Philippines. Government efforts were already directed towards the protection and promotion of health considered of paramount importance. As a result, Presidential Decree No. 856 otherwise known as "Sanitation Code of the Philippines" was passed on Dec. 1975 and was made part of the law of the land. Paragraph (c), Section 83 of the Decree states that refuse shall not be throwing in any street, sidewalk, yard, and park or in a body of water. It shall be stored in a suitable container while awaiting its final disposal.

                    <h3 align="center"> MY REFLECTION</h3>
                    <P>In this activity, I learned how to use HTML headings and paragraphs to organize content on a webpage. At first, I found it a bit challenging to remember the different heading levels, but as I practiced, I understood their purpose more clearly. Headings help show the importance of each section, while paragraphs make the text easier to read. During the activity, I enjoyed typing some content and seeing how it appeared in the browser. It felt satisfying to update the code and see the changes right away. I also realized how important clean and organized code is for making a webpage look neat.
